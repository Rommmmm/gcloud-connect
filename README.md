# gcloud-connect

connect.sh

This script is to connect to Google cloud instances without copying the ssh links. just run ./connect and you will get a list of your allowed projects and continue from there.
This is my first big script that i wrote in bash hope you will make good use of it.
for any question, email me at romanroberman@gmail.com

## update, connect.py

tried to learn some python so i made the same script in python, just without the colors.
